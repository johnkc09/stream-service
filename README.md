# screenshot-stream-service

This is just a handy little service that exposes [`screenshot-stream`](http://npm.im/screenshot-stream) as an API.

All arguments/options are exposed via the query string. For example:

```
http://localhost:8080/?url=https://javascriptair.com/?feature-show=2016-04-13&size=1200x600&crop=true
```
